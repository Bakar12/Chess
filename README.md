# Chess Game

This is a simple chess game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI.

## Files

- `board.py`: This file contains the `Board` class which is responsible for creating and displaying the chess board.
- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `Board` class and displays the chess board.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python --version` in your command line. If Python is not installed, you will need to install it.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

3. Run the command `python main.py`. This will start the tkinter main loop and display the chess board GUI.

## Future Work

- Implement the `move_piece` method in the `Board` class to allow moving the chess pieces.
- Add chess pieces to the GUI.
- Implement the rules of chess.
